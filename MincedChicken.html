        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Find plenty of ways to cook chicken mince with our versatile recipes. Make a batch of meatballs, lighter lettuce cups or mini chicken burgers.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Aromatics – to add maximum flavor we’re going to use onions, garlic, and a bell red pepper. The onions
                and pepper add a bit of sweetness and four cloves of garlic add a huge garlicky hit.</li>
            <li> Chicken – sliced boneless skinless chicken breast is what I prefer but you can use chicken thighs too.
                You’ll want to cut the chicken into bite size pieces.</li>
            <li> Spaghetti– just regular spaghetti, not the fancy stuff. But if you do want to get the fancy stuff,
                you’re looking for bronze extruded pasta with a rough surface so that the sauce can cling to it.</li>
            <li> Tomatoes – a can of diced tomatoes is going to add some umami.</li>
            <li> Milk – this is what’s going to make our sauce nice and creamy without the cream.</li>
            <li> Chicken broth – instead of using water, a little bit of chicken broth is going to help our spaghetti
                cook up with extra chicken flavor.</li>
            <li> Cheese – shredded white cheddar (or mozzarella) is stirred into the sauce and layered on top to be
                baked into a golden brown cheesy crust.</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> <strong>Sauté the aromatics </strong>In a dutch oven, melt some butter and sauté onions, diced red bell
                pepper, and garlic until soft and fragrant. </li>
            <li> Cook the chicken. Add sliced chicken and cook until golden.</li>
            <li>Stir in the liquids. Stir in diced tomatoes, chicken stock and milk to the pan.</li>
            <li>Add the pasta. Add the spaghetti and bring everything to a boil. Turn the heat down to a simmer and
                cook, tossing occasionally, until the spaghetti is tender and cooked through. If it gets too thick, stir
                in a bit more chicken stock.</li>
            <li>Cheese! Season with salt and pepper and stir in some shredded cheese until melted. Top the casserole
                with more cheese.
                Bake.</li>
            <li> Bake until bubbly and golden and enjoy!</li>
